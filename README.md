# Project Fong

Welcome - I’m Fong.  

For years I worked behind the scenes as the sole IT department, building and securing infrastructure for regulated environments.  
Now, **Project Fong** is where I bring that discipline into the open - showcasing selected work in AI systems, compliance, and infrastructure.

What you see here are **representations** of larger projects, shared selectively for visibility.
